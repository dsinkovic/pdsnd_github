## Bikeshare project

### Date created
28.07.2020.

### Description
*Bikeshare project* allows for exploring data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The data is provided by *Motivate*, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States. The project aim is to uncover bike share usage patterns through interactive querying of the databases and providing selected statistics.

* ### Interactive queries
  The program will ask the user to choose query parameters by asking the following questions:
  1. Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
  2. Would you like to filter the data by month, day, both or not at all?
  3. *(If they chose month or both)* Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
  4. *(If they chose day or both)* Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?

  Additionally, it will be offered to user to display the raw data selected with above described filters.
